## Introduction

This repository is under development. The primary objective is to generate 3D semantic point clouds from 2D images. The project is done at Fraunhofer IVI, Institute of Transportation Systems, Ingolstadt, Germany as a part of my internship. The authority to publish the methodology is owned by Fraunhofer IVI. This work is used as in my Master thesis [AirSemOcc](https://github.com/Bharadhwajsaimatha/AirSemOcc-Semantic-Occupancy-Project-for-UAS).
